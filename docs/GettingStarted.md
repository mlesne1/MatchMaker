# What is MatchMaker ?

MatchMaker is a custom matchmaking system designed for Roblox experiences that need flexibility, reliability, and real-time coordination. It leverages Promises for clean, asynchronous flows and uses MemoryStore to share data instantly across serversâ€”making it ideal for multiplayer games with party-based queues, regional distribution, and private server transitions. This tool focuses on predictability and scalability without relying on third-party services or polling workarounds.

**Key Features:**
* **Region-Based Queues:** Players are grouped by their geographic region for optimal latency and fairness.
* **Promise-Driven Asynchrony:** All operations are non-blocking and structured using robust promise chains.
* **Auto-Match Coordination:** One server becomes a **match coordinator** and is responsible for generating matches based on customizable logic.
* **Private Server Integration:** Matches are hosted on dynamically reserved private servers with persistent metadata and lifecycle tracking.
* **Graceful Error Handling:** Errors are propagated and isolated cleanly, avoiding unwanted chain continuation.
* **Custom Matchmaking Logic:** Plug in your own logic to define how players are grouped into matches.

# Installation


Make sure your game includes the following folders:

- **`ReplicatedStorage/Utils`**  
  This folder should contain the required utility modules (`Promise`, `Signal`, etc.).

- **`ServerScriptService/MatchMakerPackage`**  
  This should include the MatchMaker module files (`MatchMaker`, `RegionalQueue`, `PrivateServer`, etc.).
